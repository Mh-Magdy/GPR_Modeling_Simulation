| **Flight Planning**          | Does not support mission planning                                                                  | Offers advanced flight planning tools (photogrammetry, corridor mapping, DEM integration, etc.)      |
| **Use Case**                 | Industrial operations requiring real-time data acquisition (e.g., landmine detection, GPR surveys) | Planning and controlling missions for various drone applications (e.g., mapping, inspections)        |
| **Supports GPR**             | Fully supports GPR for real-time subsurface detection                                              | Can plan and execute missions for GPR-equipped drones                                                |

### Real-Time GPR Object Detection:
- **SkyHub**: Yes, it supports real-time GPR object detection by processing and geotagging data directly onboard during the flight.
- **UgCS**: No, it is a mission planning tool and does not process GPR data in real-time. It is used to create flight paths for GPR surveys but relies on hardware like SkyHub for data acquisition. 

**Conclusion**:
For real-time GPR object detection (e.g., landmines in sandy environments), **SkyHub** is the required system as it directly processes and identifies targets during the flight. **UgCS** is better suited as a complementary tool for pre-planning the missions.
